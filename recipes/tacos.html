        <h3>Tacos</h3>
    Delicious Zuppa Toscana soup is oh-so good! Just the right amount of spice and ingredients to give you a taste of italian cuisine!
        <h4>Ingredients</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Dried chile peppers: The flavorful birria starts with dried guajillo chile peppers, chile de arbol peppers, and ancho chiles. For a bit of extra heat, don't remove all the seeds.</li>
            <li>Beef: Beef chuck roast is perfect for braising for hours. When you're done, the meat will shred incredibly easily.</li>
            <li>Seasonings: You'll need salt, pepper, fresh garlic, whole cloves, cinnamon, cumin, thyme, marjoram, and oregano.</li>
            <li>Olive oil: Sear the meat in olive oil before you add the braising liquid.</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Steps</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Boil the dried peppers for 5 minutes, then remove from heat and let the peppers soak until the water is cool. Drain, reserving some water.</li>
            <li>Season the beef and sear on all sides in oil in a Dutch oven.</li>
            <li>Grill the tomatoes until the skin is blistered and begins to peel.</li>
        </ol>
